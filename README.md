# hash-massiveFile-onBash
system  hashing  recursive directory based on MD5  with  GTK zenity  for checking ... with repository datetime ... more than  basic  info of MD5/SHA256sum  information
this is a  script  for bash  for recursive hashing massive  files  and  directories  wish plus  of dateime , but it  can also function without dateime on md5sum compatible. 

the proposal  of this project is  create a full recursive system for hashing  for Cyber  Security, we can be use it on Linux or Windows by WSL . 

second  evolution step is  to ingest data to ELK-b stack using ecs ... so  all changes is recognized by dasboard of Kibana on SIEM .
This is the real goal of this project, sent to SIEM server  hash  of all files  system. 

third step,  we can  value this  system  also non Mobile Android
